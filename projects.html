            <p>  
                <br> Here are my completed projects so far.
                <br>
                <br> Binary Search Tree with Value conversion card game simulation:
                <br> Implemented a binary search tree class by scratch in C++, which 
                <br> stores int values. Input for the program is 2 .txt files holding
                <br> multiple playing card suits and values (strings). My program 
                <br> parses through the .txt files, converts the string values into
                <br> int values, and inserts into their respective BSTs. Both BSTs are 
                <br> then compared, and matching cards are removed from the BST. Removed
                <br> cards and remaining cards are translated back from int to string
                <br> and printed, with a description of if they were removed or not.
