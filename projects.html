                <br>
                <br> This is a program reads 2 .txt files, takes data, inserts that data into a Binary Search Tree, and compares data. The main takeaways from this project is being able to write custom data structures in C++. Rather than using a built in data structure, I wrote a lot of functions and modified pointers to make an efficient data structure, which was able to be leveraged through the creation of a "game". This was all written in C++. I also wrote a test case generator using python with numpy.

                <br> Languages: C
                <br>
                <br> Operating system for MIPS R3000 CPU. Implemented many system calls (notably write, read, exec, fork, exit, close, wait; among others). Pipes and related system calls (pipe, dup, dup2) were implemented as well, allowing for inter process communication. This was written along with a partner as part of a class project, and we improved on our useage of C by using macros and compile time definitions to help keep track of memory, as many tools like valgrind and GDB were unavailable.

                <br> Languages: MIPS Assembly, Python
                <br>
                <br> This is a proof of concept project, which takes an array of values in assembly and can encode and decode it. Rather than having execution be linear, "functions" are created which can be called again if required. These save the state of the process by placing values onto the stack and retrieving them when the function is completed. Included in this source code is also an instruction assembler written in python, which takes in a MIPS Assembly instruction and translates it to the corresponding binary and hex.

                <br>
                <br> This is an application created with a team of 7 using agile developing. The apps main features are tracking the capacity of the school gym, accessing the gyms hours and events, creating a workout schedule, and displaying a barcode to enter the gym. We developed a python script to link our frontend to a database using mongodb. My main role in the project was developing elements for the UI, and I gained experience with working on a project with a larger team and using agile development features like using our kanban board and holding daily standups and retrospective meetings. Please contact me if interested in viewing source code and if you require assistance when deploying app.
